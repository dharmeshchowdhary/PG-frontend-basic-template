        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="about-us-para">
            We are two students currently studying who cannot resist their love to work on new projects and Start ups.
            Thus,
            we have started this project as we saw a flaw, a gap, a hinderance in the system of students from different
            countries go to different places for education purpose. One of us, who himself was clueless while flying to
            study for the roommates and the location and the housing and the habits of the roommates and do you see
            where I am going with this. Exactly, Nowhere! This is why the project.

            Our aim, being students, is to fill the gap. For Free! Because we know and we understand that the students
            already have to go through a financial burden and the dilemma of choosing what is right and what is not
            without diverting their focus from their studies.
